# Angular2
getting started with Angular 2

## Notes
compenents, templates and service

### Angular - JavaScript framework for client-side applications
1. expressive HTML
2. data binding
3. modular be design
4. built-in, backen-end integration

### Angular 2
1. built for speed
2. modern JavaScript and supports greenfield and legacy browsers
3. simplified API
4. enhances productivity

### Application Anatomy
compnenet + component + component = application
component = tamplate + class (poroperties, methods) + metadata
root Angular modules, feature angular module

### Discussion
comment: I'm glad I entered the field with Angular 2 and am not distracted by differences from Angular

### Checklists
review concepts and assure quality in development

### Sample Application
* welcome compenent
* product list compenent
* prodcut detils compenent
* star compenent (nested)
* app compenent (tie the other together)
* product data service
* index.html

### Prep
1. select a language
2. select an editor, one that supports dev in that lang
3. configure boilerplate code for an Angular app

#### ECMAScript: ES5, ES2015, TypeScript or Dart
TypeScript - superset of JavaScript, trasnpiles to plain JavaScript, strong typing (data types), class-based object-orientation
